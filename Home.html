            Hopefully you enjoyed this little game. We may add more to it if people like what we made. This was a project
            made on a kitchen table, it is our first go at fiction and was a fun little project we hope to keep making. If
            this is popular enough maybe you will hear more from us. In the meantime, too da loo!
