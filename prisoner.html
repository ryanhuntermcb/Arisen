            Hahahaha I’m still here. and Dan is gone! I can’t quite comprehend why Dan acted that way, he was a little
            bit of a coward. Maybe it was desperation. I felt that pain. I feel that pain, but I’m moving forward. I
            have plans.

            It’s funny how these things work out. Corpses don’t contain faith, they cause faith. They are the reason
            anyone has faith at all. Thinking another body could contain me hahahaha.
