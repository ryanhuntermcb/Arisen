                    I used to think we were meant to find happiness, I don’t believe that any more. As soon as we
                    fulfill one desire we desire more. Our physiology reduces the pleasure derived from activities as we
                    indulge ourselves. Hedonism leads to a point where having everything in the world is not enough.

                    There used to lay within me a tacit belief that there was something more than this. But I have
                    found, quite scientifically, that all the more there is we create. We create it out of our own
                    fingertips like a field. The ‘spiritual’ we create is devoid of any higher significance. We are of
                    the highest significance. When I found something more I never imagined this would be the case.

                    The ability to create, humans revere anything capable of creation. Gods, Parents, and Nature are all
                    held in high regard for their creative capacity.

                    Creating a field, not many realize when or how they are created. Our emotional lows release a burst
                    of second layer or second derivative fields. A vessel created in another plane to house the worst
                    moments of our existence. Life may seem difficult, but without this spiritual discharge our
                    consciousness would not move on from the past. Perhaps this is why things never seem as bad when we
                    look back in time, but this is only speculative.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My doubt of faith, that burst of energy, has ‘fathered’ one of these fields. I had begun to move on
                    again when I ‘felt’, or more accurately interacted with, its field as I was documenting additional
                    findings related to the book on this site. It was a brief interaction but I felt something. Enough
                    of something to start drawing up an experiment.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The experiment was simple, subjugating myself to harmful experiences and trying to channel that
                    painful experience at objects. If my hypothesis was correct these objects would maintain said
                    fields. I found this difficult at first, but I started to gain success when trying this on objects
                    significant to me. The objects that are subjugated to these fields show measurable effects,
                    including mild repulsion to me as if a magnet as well as a seemingly slower gravitational constant.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The experiences I subjugated myself to though were rather meaningless. Largely it was self-inflicted
                    pain. Further research is needed to figure out if different types of pain create different types of
                    fields. I am going to investigate whether recent emotional turmoil has caused any of these fields to
                    permeate around me before current experiments. It seems only unique or extreme pain has real
                    recognizable fields. Luckily, these findings have caused plenty of that. <span id="regret2Key">Key

                <p>
                    These Fields are able to feel and remain perpetually in the state in which they were created. In the
                    case of my experiments only one was truly ‘successful’. Mindless but still suffering, its only
                    experience is pain without respite. In any scientific sense, it seems that this might be what people
                    mean by ‘God’.

                    Some might describe what I accidentally created as evil, but it is no more evil than the wind. Faith
                    is a hurricane, and like a hurricane it obeys its own nature. I will not shake my fist at the wind,
                    but hopefully I can build a shelter. She was created out of my own agony, and for that I am sorry.

                    With my final action I can imbue a field that is protective in nature, although I admit that it will
                    most likely be as angry. But this anger is internal, and I do not think it will strike out at
                    others. At least I hope not.
