                    Abstract: This website is for documentation of my findings and containment of unwanted materials.
                    Some of the passages displayeD were previously inscribed in letters or other mediums and are only 
                    being relayed here. This website is a monument to what I believe to be A supernatural discovery.<br><br>

                    Caution: There is risK in the pursuit of knowledge. The few who I have shown my work, and
                    thus its consequences, have become largely disillusioned with their lives.
