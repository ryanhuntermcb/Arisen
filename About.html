                    Abstract: This website is for documentation of my findings and containment of unwanted <i>materials</i>.
                    Some of the passages displayed were previously inscribed in letters or other medium and are only
                    being relayed here. This website is meant to be a monument for the moment of discovery, and a 
                    monument to what it took to get here. If there ever was an "end of history", what is documented here 
                    is a rebirth of history.<br><br>

                    Goals:<br>
                    &#8194; 1. To further contextualize our existence within the scientific supernatural <br>
                    &#8194; 2. To contain unwanted <i>materials</i> <br>
                    &#8194; 3. To serve as a maze in the event of said unwanted <i>materials</i> escaping<br>
                    &#8194; 4. To filter out the dedicated from the undedicated <br><br>

                    Warning: There is risk in the pursuit of knowledge. I have come under a heavy burden due to what I
                    have discovered. The few who I have shown my work, and thus its consequences, have become largely
                    disillusioned with their lives. Their sense of meanings in many cases have been torn from them,
                    especially in the cases that the viewing parties had typical religious views. I am constructing this
                    website to require some amount of effort to get to the intersting parts. This is to help those who,
                    understandably, have morbid curiosities about the nature of life and the thin layer beneath. Hopefully 
                    the puzzles will make most of you give up and live happy, blissful lives. This website is only for the
                    determined who cannot bear to live not knowing.<br><br>
