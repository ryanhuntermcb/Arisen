                Occasionally, I think about how when the first single celled organisms came to life they marked a stark
                deParture from what came before.
                What will the next genesis event look like where some new evolution will make living organisms pale in
                comparison? Why do we think that
                the supernatural existed before life, what if the supernatural became because of life?

                Hey Daniel,
                I found a book that you might find interesting. I mailed it to you, at least to your old address. It has
                been a long time since we’ve talked
                so I hope that if this is the wrong address it still manages to find you.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I happened to run across it while on holiday in Norway. I know you are into the paranormal stuff, maybe
                you will get a kick out of it. It is
                an old almanac or something of the sort. I think it has a little more depth to it than your previous
                excursions, remember when you wouldn’t shut
                up about transcendental meditation?
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Usually I wouldn’t just reach you out of the blue, but there is something different about this. I had a
                somewhat strange experience when trying
                to translate some of it. I don’t want to say too much out of fear of sounding like a moron, but if
                something is the real deal it is this thing.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Anyways, please come back to me with any findings. I know you like to lock yourself away, but I want to
                hear back about this.
            </p>
            <br>

                Th<i>i</i>s is something. You are usually a moron but not this time. Ple<i>a</i>se call me soon, my address hasn’t
                changed and neither has my nu<i>m</i>ber.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>I miss you pal, even i<i>f</i> I am a hermit.</p>

                The arch<i>a</i>ic text of the tome sent to my address by Isaac was unnerv<i>i</i>ngly easy to ‘transla<i>t</i>e’ the words
                seemed to project themselves into my consciousness. Almost every waking hour for the past month has been
                spent reading and rereading this book. Not<i>h</i>ing new is learned from each reading, but my mind changes
                with every passing day. I have almost begun to communicate with this book.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                When I feel my mind slipping away I am pushed to find some solid ground to stand on. I think I have an
                experiment in mind. This first experiment may be a simple distraction, but for my sanity’s sake I hope
                not. Whatever results from this, I am certain my theory will not be entirely disproven.

                There is something here. No, there is something deeper.
