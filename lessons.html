                Occasionally, I think about how when the first single celled organisms came to life they marked a stark
                deParture from what came before. What will the next genesis event look like where some new evolution
                will make living organisms pale in comparison? Why do we think that the supernatural existed before
                life, what if the supernatural became because of life? These questions have plagued my mind as I have
                navigated an existential crisis. After years of mindless optimism a switch flipped in my bRain and
                now everywhere I focus I see the vicious cycles humanity has created and has become a slave to.

                The only thing that has kEpt my abjection at bay is spending time creating this site. This artifact has
                become an outlet for my passions. When my fingers are on the keyboard I do not have to think about the
                pathetic state of the world. My only focus is making something.

                Humanity is not meant to be happy. As soon as we get something we desire more. Our physiology
                reduces the pleAsure derived from activities as we indulGe ourselves. Hedonism leads to a point
                where a human mind can no longer recover from the flood of hormones and chemicals.
