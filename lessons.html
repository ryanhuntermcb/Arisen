                Occasionally, I think about how when the first single celled organisms came to life they marked a stark
                deParture from what came before.
                What will the next genesis event look like where some new evolution will make living organisms pale in
                comparison? Why do we think that
                the supernatural existed before life, what if the supernatural became because of life?

                Hey Daniel,
                I found a book that you might find interesting. I mailed it to you, at least to your old address. It has
                been a long time since we’ve talked
                so I hope that if this is the wrong address it still manages to find you.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                I happened to run across it while on holiday in Norway. I know you are into the paranormal stuff, maybe
                you will get a kick out of it. It is
                an old almanac or something of the sort. I think it has a little more depth to it than your previous
                excursions, remember when you wouldn’t shut
                up about transcendental meditation?
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Usually I wouldn’t just reach you out of the blue, but there is something different about this. I had a
                somewhat strange experience when trying
                to translate some of it. I don’t want to say too much out of fear of sounding like a moron, but if
                something is the real deal it is this thing.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Anyways, please come back to me with any findings. I know you like to lock yourself away, but I want to
                hear back about this.
            </p><br>

                The ability to create, humans revere anything capable of creation. Gods, Parents, and Nature are all
                held in high regard for their creative capacity.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Creating a field, not many realize when or how they are created. Our emotional lows release a burst of
                second layer or second derivative fields. A
                vessel created in another plane to house the worst moments of our existence. Life may seem difficult,
                but without this spiritual discharge our
                consciousness would not move on from the past. Perhaps this is why things never seem as bad when we look
                back in time, but this is only speculative.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                My doubt of faith, that burst of energy, has ‘fathered’ one of these fields. I had begun to move on
                again when I ‘felt’, or more accurately interacted
                with, its field as I was documenting additional findings related to the book on this site. It was a
                brief interaction but I felt something. Enough of
                something to start drawing up an experiment.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                The experiment was simple, subjugating myself to harmful experiences and trying to channel that painful
                experience at objects. If my hypothesis was
                correct these objects would maintain said fields. I found this difficult at first, but I started to gain
                success when trying this on objects significant
                to me. The objects that are subjugated to these fields show measurable effects, including mild repulsion
                to me as if a magnet as well as a seemingly
                slower gravitational constant.
