        <p>We may know that the work we continue to put off doing will be bad. Worse, however, is the work we never do.
            A work that's finished is at least finished. It may be poor, but it exists... What I write, bad as it is, may
            provide some hurt or sad soul a few moments of distraction from something worse. That's enough for me, or it
            isn't enough, but is serves some purpose, and so it is with all of life.</p><br>
